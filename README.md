# Preact-compat Projects

## Introduction

Yo! This repo contains the code for the preact-compat section of my Udemy course on preact. It contains an initial react project (react-initial) as a starting point and the final version of the project we will build using preact-compat (preact-final) - that is before we break it, but we'll get to that in the course, so don't worry. 

## How To Get The Files

You should see a green button on the right that says "Clone or download". Click this button and select your preference. 

If you know how to use git, then I recommend using git clone. Simply create a new directory in your favorite place and type "git clone " in the terminal (make sure you're in the right directory) and then paste the link that is provided, and hit enter. Now, still in the terminal, run "npm install" and this will download the needed dependencies. You are now all ready to go.

If you prefer to download the files, that's cool too. Simply click the button that says "Download ZIP". Once the .zip file has finished downloading, unzip it using your preffered method and then copy the files in a new directory and you'll be ready to go.

## Have Questions or Notice an Error?

As of now, I am not very active on Github, so filing and issue in the "Issues" section probably won't be very effective at getting my attention for a while. 

So, here's what you can do. If you're from my Udemy course, please either leave a question in the Q&A section of the lesson in which I direct you to download this repo, or send me a direct message on Udemy. 

If you are not from my Udemy course and happen to be a cool cat nonetheless, you can send me a message on Twitter. My Twitter name is @punk_professor. Then you'll be a doubly cool cat. Like for real.
