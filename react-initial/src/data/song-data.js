`Hack saw one hundred percent
rack a stone wet tongue
swallow whole like

    sparrows on
              Your
        fingers
      preach medicate
            rough

I stayed up through the
    night and watched how
  your stars burst
    
open raw and how you
spat through those teeth
`;

`Semaphore
legs wave out smooth spine

tangerine and sweet
serene
burned little holes 
into reverie

Well you got by
on your own supply
wrapped all snug
like a busted up clementine

so you can come on over and
squeeze on me any time
